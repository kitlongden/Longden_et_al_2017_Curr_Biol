%% Run <Calculate_isi_all.m> in this folder. This will load data from the other
%% directories, so it is important that the folder arrangement is preserved. It
%% will save the ISI distribution data for eleven datasets in the Data folder.
%% 
%% Then run <Figure_1ABC.m>. This will save workspace variables in the Data folder.
%%  
%% In the paper we also included an additional  multiple depth planes dataset. The
%% results of this dataset were not presented so it is not included in the 
%% MendeleyData dataset. It means that there are small differences in panels D and
%% E.
%% 
%% Finally, run <Figure_1DE.m>.
