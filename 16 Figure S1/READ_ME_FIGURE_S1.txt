%% Code to plot Figure S1. 
%%
%% First run <Process_data_for_figure_S1_part_1.m> 
%%      then <Process_data_for_figure_S1_part_2.m>
%%  and then <Process_data_for_figure_S1_part_3.m>.
%% These will load data from the other directories, and save data in the Data
%% folder and subdirectories, so it is important that the folder arrangement 
%% is preserved.
%%
%% Then run <Plot_Figure_S1.m> in this folder.
